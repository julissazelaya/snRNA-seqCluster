# snRNA-seqCluster

Analysis aimed at categorizing single nuclei, GSE138852, into different clusters based on their gene expression heterogeneity, including 
1. Clustering analysis
2. Sub-clustering analysis
   - Isolates the astrocytes from the dataset, identifies sub-clusters within these astrocytes, and checks whether there are any Alzheimer's Disease (AD) - specific subclusters.
4. Differential gene expression analysis
